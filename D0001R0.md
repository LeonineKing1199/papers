# Thoughts on Asio Reflecting into the Net TS

## Introduction

The Networking TS has been a large source of contention in the C++ community and
it's the goal of this paper to report back a positive experience using
[Boost.Asio](https://github.com/boostorg/asio) as an "average Joe" developer.

For example, the author is familiar with C++ in a casual at-home setting but
professionally works with Node/JavaScript, Ruby and Go (with some light PHP
thrown in for good measure).

It's this author's belief that Asio is good for C++ and its ecosystem,
functioning perfectly as it should be: a set of low-level networking primitives
from which higher-level abstractions are composed.

## Background

C++ today is not a popular language
